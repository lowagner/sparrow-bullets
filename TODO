wrap up the physics into a class, too.

Physics
addBox  // some box added to world physics
addObserverBox // some box which will send a signal to whatever method when something collides with it
        // given some point in space (which can be updated), and some size.

figure out how the physics connects with positions, orientations, etc.

render a small map
square with walls - or no walls

player moving around, getting input

camera position - looks good for now, but give
it a player config file so players can move it where they want.

figure out world to relative coordinates, and also how to
do orientations of the players wrt the physics class.
